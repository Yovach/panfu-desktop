## Panfu Desktop

This is the official desktop application of **Panfu.us** with a built-in Flash Player.

It allows you to continue playing Panfu after the Flash Player has been removed from all major browsers.

**We are currently working on an HTML5 version and will delete the desktop application as soon as the new version is ready.**

## Contributing

We are not planning any further updates to the desktop application and will no longer support Flash Player as soon as the new version is ready.

## License

Panfu Desktop is open-source software licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
