## Introduction

This is the official desktop application for Panfu.us, the most popular private server of Panfu since 2016.

It allows you to continue playing Panfu while browsers have stopped supporting Flash Player.

## How to download?

1. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/teampanfu/panfu-desktop/releases/latest) page.
2. Download and run the appropriate file for your operating system.
3. That's it!

## How do you open it and is it safe?

This application is definitely safe and does not contain any malicious code. However, it is unsigned, which is why you will receive a warning when you open it.

On Windows, select `More Info` and `Run anyway`.

On macOS, right-click or Control-click the application and select `Open`.
